## Architecture

```
main.tsx
  └─→ ErrorBoundary
       └─→ App.tsx
            ├─→ AuthContext, PlayerContext
            ├─→ Routes (17 pages)
            └─→ AppLayout (TopNav + Sidebar + Player)
```

### Layer Rules
- Pages import from hooks/services only (no direct storage)
- Services wrap storage with business logic
- Hooks provide React integration for contexts
- Components are presentational or use hooks
